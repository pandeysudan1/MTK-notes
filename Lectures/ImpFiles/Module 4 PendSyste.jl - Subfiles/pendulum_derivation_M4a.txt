I start by telling myself what I actually want to learn:
“I want to understand **why** the pendulum equation
[
\ddot{\theta} + \frac{g}{\ell}\sin\theta = 0
]
is true, not just memorize it.”

Below is my self-learning journey in **I/We** style, using both the **force** view and the **torque** view of the same pendulum model. 

---

## 1. Setting up the mental picture

I imagine a simple pendulum:

* a point mass (bob) of mass (m)
* a massless string or rod of length (\ell)
* attached at the top, swinging under gravity
* angle (\theta(t)) measured from the **vertical**

I remind myself: the bob moves along a **circular arc**, so its motion is naturally described by (\theta(t)) rather than by (x(t),y(t)).

We adopt a **tangential axis** along the direction of motion (the red axis in the figure from the text) and a **radial axis** pointing along the string.

Gravity points straight down. I know that I must resolve gravity into components relative to the motion.

---

## 2. Force-based derivation – “I apply (F = ma) along the tangent”

### 2.1. Free-body diagram in my head

I imagine the forces on the bob:

* Weight: (\vec{F}_g = m\vec{g}) downward
* Tension: along the string toward the pivot

I remember that **tension does no work in the tangential direction** (it’s radial), so for **speed changes along the arc**, only the tangential component of gravity matters.

I ask myself: *What is the component of gravity along the tangential direction?*

The angle between the string and the vertical is (\theta). The component of gravity **along the tangent** turns out to be:
[
F_{\text{tangential}} = -mg\sin\theta
]
The negative sign tells me that this component **opposes** the positive direction of (\theta). If the pendulum is displaced to the right (positive (\theta)), the tangential force points left.

So along the tangential axis I write Newton’s second law:
[
F_{\text{tangential}} = ma_{\text{tangential}}
\Rightarrow
-mg\sin\theta = m a_{\text{tangential}}
]

I cancel (m) and obtain:
[
a_{\text{tangential}} = -g\sin\theta
]

### 2.2. Relating tangential acceleration to angular acceleration

Now I connect the tangential motion to the angle (\theta).

I recall the arc-length relationships for a circle of radius (\ell):

* Arc length: (s = \ell\theta)
* Tangential velocity: (v = \dot{s} = \ell\dot{\theta})
* Tangential acceleration: (a = \ddot{s} = \ell\ddot{\theta})

So I set
[
a_{\text{tangential}} = \ell\ddot{\theta}
]

From before, I had
[
a_{\text{tangential}} = -g\sin\theta
]

Equating them:
[
\ell\ddot{\theta} = -g\sin\theta
]

I rearrange:
[
\ddot{\theta} + \frac{g}{\ell}\sin\theta = 0
]

At this moment I pause and tell myself:
“**I’ve derived the nonlinear pendulum equation purely from forces.**”

---

## 3. Torque-based derivation – “We use (\tau = r \times F) and angular momentum”

Now I want to see the same equation but from the **rotational dynamics** viewpoint.

I recall the key relations for rotation:

* Torque: (\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F})
* Angular momentum: (\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p})
* Newton’s rotational form: (\boldsymbol{\tau} = \dfrac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt})

### 3.1. Torque from gravity

We consider the position vector (\mathbf{r}) from pivot to bob. Its magnitude is (\ell).

The gravitational force is (\mathbf{F}_g = m\mathbf{g}). The **torque** due to gravity around the pivot has magnitude
[
|\tau| = r F \sin\theta = \ell \cdot mg \cdot \sin\theta
]
The direction of the torque is such that it tends to reduce (\theta) (restoring), so we include a negative sign:
[
|\tau| = -mg\ell\sin\theta
]

I interpret the minus carefully: when (\theta > 0), gravity produces a torque that tries to pull the pendulum back toward (\theta = 0).

### 3.2. Angular momentum and its time derivative

For a point mass (m) moving in a circle of radius (\ell):

* The magnitude of angular momentum is
  [
  |L| = m r^2 \omega = m\ell^2\dot{\theta}
  ]

I take the time derivative:
[
\frac{d}{dt}|L| = m\ell^2 \ddot{\theta}
]

Now I apply (\tau = \dfrac{dL}{dt}) (magnitudes with sign):

[
-mg\ell\sin\theta = m\ell^2\ddot{\theta}
]

Again I cancel (m\ell) (assuming (\ell \neq 0)):

[
-g\sin\theta = \ell \ddot{\theta}
]

Rearranging:

[
\ddot{\theta} + \frac{g}{\ell}\sin\theta = 0
]

We end up with **exactly the same equation**. This gives me confidence that the model is consistent: both linear force analysis and rotational torque analysis lead to the same dynamics.

## 4. Reflection: what I/we have learned

At this point I summarize to myself what I’ve really gained:

1. **Physical picture**

   * I see the pendulum as a mass constrained to move along a circular arc.
   * Angle (\theta) is the natural coordinate.

2. **Force approach**

   * We project gravity along the **tangential direction**.
   * We relate tangential motion to angular motion using (s = \ell\theta).
   * We write (F = ma) in the tangential direction and obtain the nonlinear ODE.

3. **Torque approach**

   * We view the bob as a rotating point mass about the pivot.
   * Gravity produces a torque (-mg\ell\sin\theta).
   * Angular momentum is (L = m\ell^2\dot{\theta}).
   * Using (\tau = dL/dt), we recover the same ODE.

4. **The final model**
   The equation
   [
   \ddot{\theta} + \frac{g}{\ell}\sin\theta = 0
   ]
   is a **second-order nonlinear ODE** describing the angular motion of a simple pendulum under gravity.

## 5. How I can continue self-learning from here

If I want to go further, I can set myself the following “I/we” exercises:

1. **Small-angle approximation**

   * I assume (\sin\theta \approx \theta) for small (\theta).
   * We show that the equation becomes
     [
     \ddot{\theta} + \frac{g}{\ell}\theta = 0
     ]
     which is the harmonic oscillator.

2. **Energy viewpoint**

   * I write kinetic energy (T = \tfrac12 m\ell^2\dot{\theta}^2).
   * I write potential energy (V = mg\ell(1 - \cos\theta)).
   * We verify that total energy is conserved along solutions of the ODE.

3. **Numerical experiment**

   * I pick values for (g, \ell), and initial conditions (\theta(0), \dot{\theta}(0)).
   * We numerically integrate the ODE and plot (\theta(t)) to see the oscillations.

By walking through these steps in “I/we” language, I keep myself actively engaged:

* “I draw the free-body diagram.”
* “We project gravity onto the tangent.”
* “I check that the signs are consistent.”
* “We verify that both force and torque viewpoints agree.”

This way, the pendulum model becomes something I **understand** from multiple angles, not just an equation I memorize.
