"Force" derivation of (Eq. 1)

Figure 1. Force diagram of a simple gravity pendulum.
Consider Figure 1 on the right, which shows the forces acting on a simple pendulum. Note that the path of the pendulum sweeps out an arc of a circle. The angle θ is measured in radians, and this is crucial for this formula. The blue arrow is the gravitational force acting on the bob, and the violet arrows are that same force resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the bob's instantaneous motion. The direction of the bob's instantaneous velocity always points along the red axis, which is considered the tangential axis because its direction is always tangent to the circle. Consider Newton's second law,
F
=
m
a
{\displaystyle F=ma}where F is the sum of forces on the object, m is mass, and a is the acceleration. Newton's equation can be applied to the tangential axis only. This is because only changes in speed are of concern and the bob is forced to stay in a circular path. The short violet arrow represents the component of the gravitational force in the tangential axis, and trigonometry can be used to determine its magnitude. Thus,

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}F&=-mg\sin \theta =ma,\qquad {\text{so}}\\a&=-g\sin \theta ,\end{aligned}}}where g is the acceleration due to gravity near the surface of the earth. The negative sign on the right hand side implies that θ and a always point in opposite directions. This makes sense because when a pendulum swings further to the left, it is expected to accelerate back toward the right.

This linear acceleration a along the red axis can be related to the change in angle θ by the arc length formulas; s is arc length:

"Torque" derivation of (Eq. 1)
Equation (1) can be obtained using two definitions for torque.

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} ={\frac {d\mathbf {L} }{dt}}.}

First start by defining the torque on the pendulum bob using the force due to gravity.
τ
=
l

F
g
,
{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {l} \times \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {g} },}where l is the length vector of the pendulum and Fg is the force due to gravity.

For now just consider the magnitude of the torque on the pendulum.

{\displaystyle |{\boldsymbol {\tau }}|=-mg\ell \sin \theta ,}where m is the mass of the pendulum, g is the acceleration due to gravity, l is the length of the pendulum, and θ is the angle between the length vector and the force due to gravity.

Next rewrite the angular momentum.
L

(

.
{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {r} \times ({\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times \mathbf {r} ).}Again just consider the magnitude of the angular momentum.

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}|\mathbf {L} |=m\ell ^{2}{\frac {d^{2}\theta }{dt^{2}}},}
